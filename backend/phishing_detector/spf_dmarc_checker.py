def check_spf_dmarc(domain: str) -> dict:
    """
    Checks the SPF and DMARC DNS records for a given email domain.

    SPF Check:
    - Queries TXT records of the domain.
    - If a record starting with "v=spf1" is found, SPF status is PASS.
    - If no SPF record is found, SPF status is FAIL and adds 20 to score.
    - If the DNS query fails, SPF status is UNKNOWN and adds 20 to score.

    DMARC Check:
    - Queries TXT records of _dmarc.<domain>.
    - If a record starting with "v=DMARC1" is found, DMARC status is PASS.
    - If no DMARC record is found, DMARC status is FAIL and adds 10 to score.
    - If the DNS query fails, DMARC status is UNKNOWN and adds 10 to score.

    Args:
        domain: The email domain to check (e.g. "google.com").

    Returns:
        A dictionary with:
            spf_status (str): "PASS", "FAIL", or "UNKNOWN"
